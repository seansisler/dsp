**Exercise:** The numbers generated by `numpy.random.random` are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability.

Generate 1000 numbers from `numpy.random.random` and plot their PMF.  What goes wrong?

Now plot the CDF. Is the distribution uniform?


```python
# Solution goes here
numbers = np.random.random(1000)
```


```python
# Solution goes here
numbers_pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(numbers)
thinkplot.Pmf(numbers_pmf)
```

```python
# Solution goes here
numbers_cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(numbers)
thinkplot.Cdf(numbers_cdf)
```




    {'xscale': 'linear', 'yscale': 'linear'}

When plotting the pmf, the numbers are evenly disbursed so we see no visualization produced that is useful when the Pmf is produced. The CDF plotted shows that np.random.random uniformly generates the set of numbers. 


```python

```
